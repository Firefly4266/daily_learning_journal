## Entry Class #13


27 July 2017

### Subjects Covered

  - Heroku
  - Deployment
  - Closure patterns 

### Lessons Learned

Today I learned more about Heroku and deployment.  I find Heroku very convoluted and difficult to work with. I have some things deployed there but not much because it is a pain to manage.  I would NOT use this service if it were my choice since there are more user friendly tools out there that won't waste hours of my time serching for small configurations.  Simplicity = elegance.
