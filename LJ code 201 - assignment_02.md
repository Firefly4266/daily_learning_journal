### Subjects Covered

  - Objects
  - Domain modeling

### Lessons Learned
Todays lesson was on objects, the DOM and domain modeling.  To add something to the DOM requires 3 basic steps.  1) chose the element to be manipulated. 2) create the object that you are adding. 3) append the new object to the chosen element.  

We also discussed objects in JavaScript in more depth. Everything in JavaScript is an object which makes it easy to store, change, and access values among other things.
