### Lessons Learned

This week was all about managing many parts of a more complicated application.  In working with Salmon cookies I was able to solve getting the hourly tallies for the individual stores.  When I was first exposed to this project I was never able to accomplish that.  It was very cool to figure out how to access the data I needed even when it was nested inside of a function.
