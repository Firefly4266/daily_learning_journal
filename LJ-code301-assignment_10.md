# LJ code 301 - assignment 10

## Entry Class #10


24 July 2017

### Subjects Covered

  - Closures
  - IIFE
  - Functional programming

### Lessons Learned

Today we learned about functional programming which is a mor declarative way of programming.  When you use a functional pattern, there is more abstraction so the code may be less user readable to those with less knowledge of the code base. We also learned to use an IIFE closure pattern to control what we allow into the global name space.
