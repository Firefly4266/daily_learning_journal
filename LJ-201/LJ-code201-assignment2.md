## Lessons Learned

Working with the about-me assignment brought back some interesting issues with using vanilla JavaScript.  I was having a particularly hard time covering all of the edge cases for validating text entry.  Even though this was not a specific assignment requirement I thought it would be a lot easier that it actually was.  Managing extremely detailed validation block can be very confusing so it's best approached by validating one case at a time to ensure no conflicting rules or unintended outcomes.
