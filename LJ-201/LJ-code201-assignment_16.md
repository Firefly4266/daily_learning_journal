### Lessons Learned

Today we came together as project teams and started working on scaffolding out our final project.  The main purpose was to layout objectives and set a project flow so we stay focused on reaching MVP.  The key is to write descriptive and meaningful user stories supported by well written technical requirements. With these in place we also wrote out a team agreement that sets boundries and expectations for the behavior of group members.
