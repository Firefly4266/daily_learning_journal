### Lessons Learned

Today I learned a little bit about my problem solving methodology (or rather rediscovered).  During a class demo, something went wrong with the server file where we were not able to close down a port in operation.  While at first I was focused (along with everyone else) on finding the error in the code so we get the desired functionality. At some point however, my mind made a shift to "what are we trying to accomplish?". With this shift in thought I realized that at the moment the error was not as important as the process that was trying to be explained which led to a more immediate solution to the problem which was to switch ports, finish the demo, then go back and find the issue with the code. Later in the day it occurred to me that this is my problem solving/trouble shooting methodology. Stay focused on the problem, recognize what is part of the actual problem and what is interesting distraction, staying on point and find the most efficient solution to the problem conventional or nonconventional.
