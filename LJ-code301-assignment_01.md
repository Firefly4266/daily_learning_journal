### Lessons Learned

Today I learned the importance of setting the initial view port for the web page.  This is do so that you have an initial scale before you start changing screen sizes. The initial-scale property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. The maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
