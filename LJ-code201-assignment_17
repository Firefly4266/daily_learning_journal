### Subjects Covered

  - User model

### Lessons Learned

Today we started coding out our project.  We split into pairs as divided you tasks. The two areas we concentrated on were creating the user model and the view object.  The model is the player object which encompasses the sub object, and the view is the board where the game will be played.
