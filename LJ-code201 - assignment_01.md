## Lessons Learned

In the course of completing assignment #1, I discovered a way to control the opacity of a background image using a CSS technique.  Prior to this I would alter the image with an image editing program in order to get the desired effect.  This time however, I thought I'd take a look at CSS techniques to see if it could be easily done now that I'm a bit more proficient with using CSS.  Once I figured out how to do it, it was actually an "ah-ha" moment as I could see uses for this particular technique other than manipulating image opacity.
