### Lessons Learned
Today was final presentations.  It went well, better than expected. I learned that there are definite limits to my patients dealing with some personality types.  In the future I need to be able to recognize this limitation early so that I will be able to compartmentalize my individual feelings so that I can move forward and be a more productive team member.
